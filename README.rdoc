== SHOPPRR

This is a basic shopping cart to be used and built upon as a template.  This will have a section for individual sellers to upload products available for sale, as well as options for them to ship those products and collect payment.

There will also be a section for buyers to view a list of available products, and also purchase those products.  

There will also (obviously) be a shopping cart associated with each individual user's purchases, that will be dynamically updated.

Early development phase, stay tuned...
